# Exercise

Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of `f`
correctly (assuming that `f` and `frac_part` are `float` variables)?

```c
frac_part = f - (int) f;
```

## Solution

No. Converting `f` to `int` may cause undefined behaviour if the integral part
of `f` can't be represented by `int`, i.e., it exceeds the largest value `int`
can represent.
