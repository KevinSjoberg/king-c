# Exercise

Suppose `i` is a variable of type `int`, `f` is a variable of type `float`,
and `d` is a variable of type `double`. What is the type of the expression
`i * f / d`?

## Solution

`double`. `i` is converted to a `float`, and then divided by `f`. Since `d` is
of type `double`, the result of the previous expression is promoted to a
`double` as well.
