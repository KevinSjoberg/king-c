# Exercise

Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `j` is a variable of type
`long`, and  `k` is a variable of type `unsigned int`. What is the type of
the expression `i + (int) j * k`?

## Solution

`unsigned int`. `j` is explicitly cast to `int` but then promoted to an
`unsigned int` due to it being multiplied by `k`.
