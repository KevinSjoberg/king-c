# Project

The `square2.c` program of Section 6.3 will fail (usually by printing strange
answers) if `i * i` exceeds the maximum `int` value. Run the program and
determine the smallest value of `n` that causes failure. Try changing the type
of `i` to `short` and running the program again. Then try `long`. From these
experiments, what can you conclude about the number of bits used to store
integer types on your machine?

## Solution

`int` is stored as 32 bits and `46341` cause the program to produce unexpected
output. `short` is 16 bits and `182` cause the program to produce unexpected
output. `long` is 64 bits (took to long to validate unexpected output).
