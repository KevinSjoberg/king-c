# Exercise

Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `f` is a variable of type
`float`, and `d` is a variable of type `double`. Explain what conversions
take place during the execution of the following statement:

```c
d = i + f;
```

## Solution

`i` is promoted into a `float` and the result of `i + f` is then promoted into
a `double` when assigned to `d`.
