# Exercise

Which one of the following is not a legal way to write the number 65? (Assume
that the character set is ASCII.)

- `'A'`
- `0b1000001`
- `0101`
- `0x41`

## Solution

`0b1000001`. C does not have binary literals even though modern compilers such
as `gcc` and `cc` support it via compiler extensions.
