# Exercise

What output does the following program fragment produce?

```c
sum = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2)
    continue;
  sum += 1;
}
printf("%d\n", sum);
```

## Solution

The output would be:

```
20
```

Since `i % 2` will only be zero for even numbers. This leaves us with the
number 2, 4, 6, 8 which, when added together, equals 20.
