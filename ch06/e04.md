# Exercise

Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
(assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

- `for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}`
- `for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {}`
- `for (i - 0; i++ < 10; ) {}`

## Solution

`for (i - 0; i++ < 10; )` due to the fact that it increments `i` before the
loop body.
