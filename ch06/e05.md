# Exercise

Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other two
(assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

- `while (i < 10) {}`
- `for (; i < 10;) {}`
- `do { } while (i < 10)`

## Solution

`do { } while (i < 10)` due to the fact that the loop body will run at least
once. Even if `i == 10`.
