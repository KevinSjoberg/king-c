# Exercise

Find the error in the following program fragment and fix it.

```c
if (n % 2 == 0);
  printf("n is even\n");
```

## Solution

The `printf` is not part of the `if` statement's body. So the program could in
fact be written as follows:

```c
if (n % 2 == 0)
  /* Empty body */;
printf("n is even\n");
```

See `e14.c`.
