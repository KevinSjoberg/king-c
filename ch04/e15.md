# Exercise

Give the values of `i` and `j` after each of the following expression
statements has been executed. (Assume that `i` has the value `1` initially and
`j` has the value `2`.)

- `i += j;`
- `i--;`
- `i * j / i;`
- `i % ++j;`

## Solution

- `i` is `3` and `j` is `2`
- `i` is `0` and `j` is `2`
- `i` is `1` and `j` is `2`
- `i` is `1` and `j` is `3`
