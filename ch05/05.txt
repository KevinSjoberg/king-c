Yes, it's legal but it doesn't do what you think it does.

n >= 1 <= 10 will be evaluated as ((n >= 1) <= 10), thus, if n is 1 or larger
the result of (n >= 1) will be 1, otherwise 0.

In any case, the expression will always evaluate to true since both 0 and 1 is
less than 10 and thus always printing "n is between 1 and 10".
