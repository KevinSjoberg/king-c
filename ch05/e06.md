# Exercise

Is the following `if` statement legal?

```c
if (n == 1-10)
  printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
```

If so, what does it do when `n` is equal to 5?

## Solution

Yes, it's legal but it doesn't do what you think it does.

`(n == 1-10)` will be evaluated as `(n == (1-10))`, thus always comparing `n`
with -9. The expression will evaluate to false for all values of `n` except -9.
