# Exercise

The following program fragments illustrate the relational and equality
operators. Show the output produced by each, assuming that `i`, `j`, and `k`
are `int` variables.

```c
i = 2; j = 3;
k = i * j == 6;
printf("%d", k);
```

```c
i = 5; j = 10; k = 1;
printf("%d", k > 1 < j);
```

```c
i = 3; j = 2; k = 1;
printf("%d", i < j == j < k);
```

```c
i = 3; j = 4; k = 5;
printf("%d", i % j + 1 < k);
```

## Solution

See `e01.c`.
