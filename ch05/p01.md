# Project

Write a program that calculates how many digits a number contains:

```
Enter a number: 374
The number 374 contains 3 digits
```

You may assume that the number has no more than four digit. *Hint:* Use `if`
statements to test the number. For example, if the number is between 0 and 9,
it has one digit. If the number is between 10 and 99, it has two digits.

## Solution

See `p01.c`.
