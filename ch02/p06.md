# Project

Modify the program of Programming Project 5 so that the polynomial is
evaluated using the following formula:

```
((((3𝗑 + 2)𝗑 - 5)x - 1)x + 7)𝗑 - 6
```

Note that the modified program performs fewer multiplications. This technique
for evaluating polynomials is known as the **Horner's Rule**.

## Solution

See `p06.c`
