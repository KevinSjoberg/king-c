# Exercise

Consider the following program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
    printf("fill the time\n");
    printf("available for its completion.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

- Identify the directives and statements in this program.
- What output does the program produce?

## Solution

The program has 1 directive (`#include <stdio.h>`) and 4 statements
(3 x `printf` and 1 `return`). The output of the program is the following:

```
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.
```
