# Project

Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a 10-meter radius,
using the formula `𝗏 = 4/3π𝘳³`. Write the fraction 4/3 as `4.0f/3.0f`. (Try
writing it as `4/3`. What happens?) *Hint:* C doesn't have an exponentiation
operator, so you'll need to multiply 𝘳 by itself twice to compute 𝘳³.

## Solution

See `p02.c`.
