# Exercise

We discussed using the expression `sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0])` to calculate the
number of elements in an array. The expression `sizeof(a) / sizeof(t)`, where
`t` is the type of `a`'s elements, would also work, but it's considered an
inferior technique. Why?

## Solution

Because if the type of `a`'s elements change, you'd also have to remember to
change `t` to the matching type. Nothing is guaranteeing the correctness of `t`
matching the type of `a`'s elements.
