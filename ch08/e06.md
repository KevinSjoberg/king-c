# Exercise

Calculators, watches, and other electronic devices often rely on seven-segment
displays for numerical output. To from a digit, such devices "turn on" some
of the seven segments while leaving others "off":

```
 __            __     __            __     __     __     __     __
|  |      |    __|    __|   |__|   |__    |__       |   |__|   |__|
|__|      |   |__     __|      |    __|   |__|      |   |__|    __|

```

Suppose that we want to set up an array that remembers which segments should
be "on" for each digit. Let's number the segments as follows:

```
  _0_
5|_6_|1
4|_3_|2
```

Here's what the array might look like, wiyj each row representing one digit:

```c
const int segments[10][7] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0}};
```

I've given you the first row of the initializer, fill in the rest.


## Solution

```c
const int segments[10][7] = {
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0},
    {0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1},
    {0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
    {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1},
    {1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
    {1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1}
};
```
