# Exercise

Using the array of Exercise 8, write a program fragment that computes the
average temperatures for a month (averaged over all days of the month and all
hours of the day).

## Solution

```c
float average_temperature = 0.0f;

for (int i = 0; i < DAYS; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < HOURS; j++)
        average_temperature += temperature_readings[i][j];
}

average_temperature /= DAYS * HOURS;

printf("Average temperature: %.2f\n", average_temperature);
```
