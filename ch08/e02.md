# Exercise

The Q&A section shows how to use a letter as an array subscript. Describe how
to use a digit (in character form) as a subscript.

## Solution

Given a digit `d`, we could scale it accordingly by doing `a[d-'0']`. Assuming
that digits have consecutive codes in the underlying character set, which is
true of ASCII and other popular character sets.
