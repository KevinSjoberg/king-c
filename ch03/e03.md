# Exercise

For each of the following pairs of `scanf` format strings, indicate whether or
not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, show how they can be
distinguished.

- `"%d"` versus `" %d"`
- `"%d-%d-%d"` versus `"%d -%d -%d"`
- `"%f"` versus `"%f "`
- `"%f,%f"` versus `"%f, %f"`

## Solution

- Equal.
- Not equal. The second format string allow spaces after each number, while the
  first format string does not.
- Not Equal. The second format string will ignore any whitespace characters
  after the number, including newline. Thus, a non-whitespace character must be
  provided after the number.
- Equal.
