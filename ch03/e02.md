# Exercise

Write calls of `printf` that display a `float` variable `x` in the following
formats.

- Exponential notation; left-justified in a field of size 8; one digit after
  the decimal point.
- Exponential notation; right-justified in a field of size 10; six digits after
  the decimal point.
- Fixed decimal notation; left-justified in a field of size 8; three digits
  after the decimal point.
- Fixed decimal notation; right-justified in a field of size 6; no digits after
  the decimal point.

## Solution

- `printf("%-8.1e\n", x);`
- `printf("%10.6e\n", x);`
- `printf("%-8.3f\n", x);`
- `printf("%6.0f\n", x);`
